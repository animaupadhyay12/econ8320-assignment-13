        "As we know from (painful?) experience, Python is powerful because of its ability to leverage `numpy` and `scipy` to implement any statistical model from scratch. We can write the requisite matrix algebra, or the relevant likelihood function, and from there can optimize our model, calculate confidence intervals, and report the output of that model through data frames, lists, or printed tables. Building our own models is great! We get to build a model based on the exact context and assumptions of our problem, and therefore get exactly the model that we wanted. Unfortunately, it takes a LOT of time!\n",
        "\n",
        "This lesson will provide our first exposure to pre-written statistical modeling in Python. We will be able to use only a couple of lines of code to implement complex and valuable statistical and machine learning models. Because the most costly asset in programming is the time that we spend debugging and writing code (running code is MUCH faster and cheaper than the time spent writing code), we are always looking for ways to avoid writing code that someone else has already written.\n",

        "What `statsmodels` does for regression analysis, `sklearn` does for predictive analytics and machine learning. It is a truly fabulous library. `sklearn` is likely the most popular machine learning library, and has a standard API to make using the library VERY simple. Even better, it's documentation is some of the nicest documentation you will find anywhere, and contains incredible detail about how to implement models, as well as lessons about the \"how\" and \"why\" of using each model. You couldn't write a better textbook about machine learning than the documentation for `sklearn`.\n",

        "Below, we will briefly discuss some of the models that are most commonly utilized from `sklearn`. Details will be sparse. We are mostly focused on the code implementation of these models. More detail on how machine learning models work is provided in  Business Forecasting, and is outside the scope of this course.\n",
